### BDD

1. The behaviour of an Isoscles triangle is when two side are equal. E.g(20; 20;17 ) Therefore, output example is: The value[20,20,17] is Isoscele Triangle.
2. The behavior of an equirateral triangle is when all sides are equal.E.g ( 21; 21; 21), Therefore , the rusult : The value[21,21,21] is Equilaterial Triangle.
3. The behavior of  Scalene Triangle   None of the sides are equal .E.g (10,12,14),  Therefore , the rusult : The value[10,12,14] is Scalene Triangle.

4. Other behavior is when The summation of any two sides is not equal to the third sum ( 3; 6; 2 ), the result is The value[3,6,2] is Not a Triangle.

5. The last one is when the one side or all side is zero or no thing. eg1 ( 0; 0; 0 ), Eg2 (2,0,1) the rusult1: The value[0,0,0] is Undefined, the rusult2: The value[2,0,1] is Undefined
