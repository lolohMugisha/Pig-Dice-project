## Description
This is website or webpage which is a game.to be more precise its a roll the dice game .From the title it involves two players and also involves a dice,
The Pig-Dice game is a fun game based on two players rolling a dice.

A player rolls the die until either:

1. A one is rolled
2. The player chooses to hold i.e. stop rolling
When a one is rolled, accumulated points are discarded and the other player takes over the dice.
When a player rolls a 2 - 6, the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.
When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.



When Hold is pressed, the accumulated points are added to the player's final Score.

The other player then takes the die over.

### BDD

1. The behaviour of an Isoscles triangle is when two side are equal. E.g(20; 20;17 ) Therefore, output example is: The value[20,20,17] is Isoscele Triangle.
2. The behavior of an equirateral triangle is when all sides are equal.E.g ( 21; 21; 21), Therefore , the rusult : The value[21,21,21] is Equilaterial Triangle.
3. The behavior of  Scalene Triangle   None of the sides are equal .E.g (10,12,14),  Therefore , the rusult : The value[10,12,14] is Scalene Triangle.

4. Other behavior is when The summation of any two sides is not equal to the third sum ( 3; 6; 2 ), the result is The value[3,6,2] is Not a Triangle.

5. The last one is when the one side or all side is zero or no thing. eg1 ( 0; 0; 0 ), Eg2 (2,0,1) the rusult1: The value[0,0,0] is Undefined, the rusult2: The value[2,0,1] is Undefined
