## Description
This is website or webpage which is a game.to be more precise its a roll the dice game .From the title it involves two players and also involves a dice,
The Pig-Dice game is a fun game based on two players rolling a dice.

A player rolls the die until either:

1. A one is rolled
2. The player chooses to hold i.e. stop rolling
When a one is rolled, accumulated points are discarded and the other player takes over the dice.
When a player rolls a 2 - 6, the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.
When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.
